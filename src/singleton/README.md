#### File Structure

#### Test

```

## Breakdown

### Key Points

- :white_check_mark: Guarantees that only one instance of a class exists.
- :white_check_mark: Provides a single point of access (usually through a static method).
- :white_check_mark: Often implemented using lazy initialization (instance created only when needed).
- :white_check_mark: Useful for managing shared resources, such as database connections, logging systems, or configuration settings.

## Benefits

- :white_check_mark: **Controlled Access** â€“ Prevents multiple instances from being created accidentally.
- :white_check_mark: **Efficient Resource Management** â€“ Saves memory and improves performance by sharing resources.
- :white_check_mark: **Thread-Safe (if implemented correctly)** â€“ Avoids race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
- :white_check_mark: **Global Access Point** â€“ Ensures that different parts of an application use the same instance.

## Drawbacks

- :no_entry_sign: **Tight Coupling** â€“ Since the instance is globally accessible, classes depending on the singleton become tightly coupled to it, reducing flexibility.
- :no_entry_sign: **Difficult to Test** â€“ Singleton objects introduce global state, making unit tests less predictable and harder to isolate.
- :no_entry_sign: **Hidden Dependencies** â€“ Since singletons are accessible anywhere, they hide dependencies, making it harder to track where changes affect the system.
- :no_entry_sign: **Concurrency Issues** â€“ In multi-threaded environments, improper implementation can lead to race conditions or performance bottlenecks.
- :no_entry_sign: **Harder to Scale** â€“ If an application grows beyond a single-machine setup, a singleton might not work well in a distributed system.
- :no_entry_sign: **Inflexibility** â€“ Once a singleton is implemented, changing or extending its behavior can be complex without modifying multiple parts of the application.
