# Prototype

#### File Structure

```bash
ðŸ“¦ src/prototype
 â”£ ðŸ“œ prototype.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md
ðŸ“¦ test/prototype
 â”£ ðŸ“œ prototype.test.ts
```

#### Test

```bash
npm run test:prototype
```

## Breakdown

### Key Points
- Uses a `clone()` method to duplicate objects.
- Avoids repetitive instantiation logic.
- Works well with objects that have many configurations.
- Helps maintain performance by reducing creation overhead.

### Benefits
- **Performance Boost** â€“ Cloning is faster than re-instantiating complex objects.
- **Simplifies Object Creation** â€“ Reduces dependency on constructors.
- **Preserves Object State** â€“ Ensures consistency across instances.
- **Encourages Loose Coupling** â€“ Reduces reliance on specific classes.

### Drawbacks

#### Complexity in Cloning
- Deep copying can be tricky, especially with nested objects.
- Requires careful handling of references to avoid unintended sharing.

#### Increased Maintenance
- If object structure changes, clone() logic must be updated.
- More effort is needed to ensure correct copying behavior.

#### Hidden Dependencies
- Cloning can obscure dependencies, making debugging harder.
- Developers might overlook what gets copied versus referenced.

#### Memory Overhead
- Cloning large objects can lead to unnecessary memory usage.
- Risk of creating excessive objects if not managed properly.

#### Not Always Necessary
- If object creation is cheap, the pattern adds unnecessary complexity.
- In some cases, a factory or constructor is a simpler alternative
